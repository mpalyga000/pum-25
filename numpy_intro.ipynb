    "NumPy arrays are faster and more memory efficient than Python lists. NumPy arrays are also homogeneous: all elements of a NumPy array have the same data type. This allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays much faster than Python lists. In machine learning and data science, where you often work with large datasets, you will quickly find yourself unable to compute anything in reasonable timeframes using only native Python data structures.\n",
