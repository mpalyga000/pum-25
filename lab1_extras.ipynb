    "**Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. If you happen not to have heard of the Game of Life before, try it out yourself at [this website](https://playgameoflife.com/) and see what it is about. It's not a *game* in the traditional sense, because there are no players, rather a simulation of an evolving system (often referred to as a *zero-player game*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of squares (cells), each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or 1 and 0). At each step in time, some cells are born, some die, and some stay the same, according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A live cell with **fewer than two** live neighbors **dies** of underpopulation.\n",
    "2. A live cell with **two or three** live neighbors **lives** on to the next generation.\n",
    "3. A live cell with **more than three** live neighbors **dies** of overpopulation.\n",
    "4. A dead cell with **exactly three** live neighbors becomes a live cell as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user is supposed to draw some initial configuration of live and dead cells and watch how the system evolves with time. Not all initial configurations of cells will lead to interesting results. Some will die out in a few time steps, but some will evolve into complex shapes with really cool properties. I highly encourage you to play around with the Game of Life yourself before we implement it in Pyhton.\n",

    "Implement the Game of Life's board as class `GameOfLife`. The class should have the following methods:\n",
    "- `__init__(self, width, height, prob)`: Initializes a random Game of Life board (in terms of live and dead cells) of the given width and height. Creates the board using the `get_random_board` method and stores it in the instance variable `self.board` (already done for you).\n",

    "One can simulate the results of such a game in many ways. One example is by assigning a value of 0 to each left bounce and 1 to each right bounce. As the ball falls through $n$ rows, its final position (bin index) is determined by the sum of the values in each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a class called `Pachinko` that represents a simplified pachinko board of $k$ rows. The class should have a method called `drop_balls` that simulates dropping $n$ balls through the board and returns the list of $n$ integers, corresponding to the final position (bin index) of each ball.\n",
    "2. Create a function called `plot_pachinko`. It should take a Pachinko object and the number of balls $n$ as arguments. The function should simulate dropping $n$ balls through the board and return a histogram of the distribution of balls in all bins (you can use the `plot_hist` function from the previous exercise to return the histogram).\n",
    "3. Plot the histogram of the results of dropping 1000 balls through a pachinko board with $k=5, 10, 20$ rows. What shape does this distribution converge to as the number of rows increases? *What exactly does this experiment have in common with the means of multiple dice rolls?*\n",
    "4. You encounter a 10-row pachinko machine. One game (equivalent of dropping one ball) costs you 10 yen. If the ball lands in either the first or last bin, you win 2500 yen. You can play as many times as you wish. Will this machine make the casino go bankrupt? Conduct a simulation to verify your prediction."
